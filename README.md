# demo project

## Overview

- This is my README file to demonstrate the demo project.
  I will be doing code with `HTML` , `CSS`, and `javaScript`.

- It is designed for beginners to understand the structure and interaction of the core web development technologies.

### Features

1. **HTML Structure:**

   - Displays a welcoming header: "Hello World, Habiba!"
   - Includes a friendly message: "Nice to see you!"

2. **CSS Styling:**

   - The page is linked to an external stylesheet (`style.css`) for styling.

3. **JavaScript Interaction:**
   - A script (`main.js`) is included for dynamic functionality.
   - An alert message welcomes users to learning JavaScript.
